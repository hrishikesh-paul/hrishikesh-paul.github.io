            "FOR THE MUSHROOMS: Slice off the mushroom caps and save for another use (see Pro Tip). Trim the bases so the stems are clean. (In the next steps, you\u2019ll be pressing the mushroom stems to make them thinner, flatter, and more pliable for skewering.)",
            "Heat a large heavy pan (such as cast iron) over medium-high heat. When it\u2019s hot, swirl 3 tablespoons of the oil in the pan to coat the bottom, then add the mushrooms. After a minute or so, use a second heavy pan or a couple of foil-wrapped bricks to weight down and press/sear the mushrooms. Cook for 2 minutes, then pour the water around the mushrooms. (The steam will help soften themushrooms and flatten the round shape into a squarer shape, which is easier to skewer.) Continue pressing for 2 to 3 minutes, then flip the mushrooms over. When the \u2019shrooms are tender and pliable, 2 to 3 minutes longer, remove them to a work surface. Let cool for 15 minutes or so.",
            "Meanwhile, mix together the remaining 2 tablespoons oil and the tamari, agave, sriracha, and hot chile oil to make your marinade.",
            "When the mushrooms are cool, slice them lengthwise into strips about \u00bc inchthick. Arrange the strips in a single layer on a baking sheet and brush them all over with the marinade, using it all. Let marinate at room temperature for at least 1 hour. Or, if you have time, cover and marinate in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. The longer you marinate, the more flavor you\u2019ll get.",
            "Soak a handful of wooden skewers in water to cover for 30 minutes. When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 350\u00baF. Thread each strip of mushroom on a skewer, making as many ribbon folds as possible without breaking the mushroom. Place the skewers on a baking sheet and bake in the hot oven until lightly browned, 20 to 30 minutes.",
            "FOR THE SAUCE: Combine all the ingredients in a blender and buzz it all up until smooth. For a thicker sauce, use less water; use more to make it thinner.",
            "Drizzle a little sauce over the skewers before serving with the remainder on the side for dipping."

        "instructions": [
            "Preheat oven to 450 degrees F",
            "In a high speed blender add cashews, almond milk, half a cup of coconut milk, vegetable buillon, and mushrooms stems. Pulse on high for 3 minutes in 30 second intervals.",
            "After sauce has pulsed for 3 minutes, let rest while roasting the garlic and tomatoes.",
            "While oven is preheating, half the cherry tomatoes and place on a lined baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and a drizzle of oil.",
            "Cut the top of a garlic head off. Drizzle a bit more of salt, pepper, and olive oil. Wrap in foil.",
            "Roast both the tomatoes and garlic for about 30-40 minutes.",
            "Next add the last half cup of coconut milk to the blender and pulse another minute.",
            "Once garlic is roasted, add to blender. Pulse another 3 minutes.",
            "Check consistency. If you like it, then stop here! Add a bit more salt and pepper if you'd like, and don't forget those red pepper flakes!",
            "Personally, I like my sauce slightly thicker, so I add about a tablespoon of flour and pulse for 2-3 minutes. I check again and add flour, salt, pepper, and red peppers flakes as I see fit",
            "Cook Noodles according to package",
            "In a large sautee pan, add mushrooms and sautee for about 8-10 minutes on medium-high heat. One of the many lessons I've learned from the great Julia Childs is to not crowd the mushrooms, so please, don't do it. The difference is amazing and you'll be thanking me.",
