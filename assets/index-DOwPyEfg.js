Trim the bases so the stems are clean. (In the next steps, you’ll be pressing the mushroom stems to make them thinner, flatter, and more pliable for skewering.)","Heat a large heavy pan (such as cast iron) over medium-high heat. When it’s hot, swirl 3 tablespoons of the oil in the pan to coat the bottom, then add the mushrooms. After a minute or so, use a second heavy pan or a couple of foil-wrapped bricks to weight down and press/sear the mushrooms. Cook for 2 minutes, then pour the water around the mushrooms. (The steam will help soften themushrooms and flatten the round shape into a squarer shape, which is easier to skewer.) Continue pressing for 2 to 3 minutes, then flip the mushrooms over. When the ’shrooms are tender and pliable, 2 to 3 minutes longer, remove them to a work surface. Let cool for 15 minutes or so.","Meanwhile, mix together the remaining 2 tablespoons oil and the tamari, agave, sriracha, and hot chile oil to make your marinade.","When the mushrooms are cool, slice them lengthwise into strips about ¼ inchthick. Arrange the strips in a single layer on a baking sheet and brush them all over with the marinade, using it all. Let marinate at room temperature for at least 1 hour. Or, if you have time, cover and marinate in the refrigerator for up to 2 days. The longer you marinate, the more flavor you’ll get.","Soak a handful of wooden skewers in water to cover for 30 minutes. When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 350ºF. Thread each strip of mushroom on a skewer, making as many ribbon folds as possible without breaking the mushroom. Place the skewers on a baking sheet and bake in the hot oven until lightly browned, 20 to 30 minutes.","FOR THE SAUCE: Combine all the ingredients in a blender and buzz it all up until smooth. For a thicker sauce, use less water; use more to make it thinner.","Drizzle a little sauce over the skewers before serving with the remainder on the side for dipping."],"categories":["(Can Be Made) Gluten-Free","Appetizers"],"id":"263"},{"name":"Vegan Ceviche","description":"Vegan ceviche - easy, delicious vegan ceviche loaded with young coconut meat, tomatoes, cucumber, cilantro, onions and jalapeños, and marinated in fresh lime juice and zesty seasonings.
